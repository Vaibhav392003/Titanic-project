# Titanic-project

This is the project of Logistic Regression. Which is based on Most Famouse insedence of "Titanic" here the prediction of sevival is done in this project this prediction is based on the Gender , Age , Compartment of traveling and many other factors. The skills I used in this projects are Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Meachine Learning - Logistic Regression. 

Dive into the chilling waters of the Titanic disaster with this data-driven Python project, We'll harness the power of logistic regression, a statistical lifeboat, to predict passengers' survival chances based on their age and even pinpoint the ship's compartments most impacted by tragedy. Pandas will organize our passenger data, NumPy will fuel the mathematical calculations, and Scikit-learn will guide our model towards accurate insights. But the journey doesn't end there! Expand your exploration by including more features like class or travel companions, visualize the results to uncover hidden patterns, and even test other AI algorithms for comparison. Remember, while data unlocks mysteries, it can't replace the human stories. Approach this project with respect, honoring the lives lost while learning from the data's whispers.
